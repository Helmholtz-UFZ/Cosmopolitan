# Skill: Run and Fix Failing Tests

Step-by-step checklist for running tests, diagnosing failures, and fixing issues in the COSMOPOLITAN test suite.

---

## 1. Clarification Questions

Ask the user before starting:

1. **Failure location** — Did the test fail locally, in the CI pipeline, or both?
2. **Test scope** — Which test file is failing, or is it the full suite?
3. **New or regression** — Did this test pass before, or is it newly written?
4. **Error message** — What error are you seeing? (paste the output)

---

## 2. Step-by-step Diagnostic Checklist

**Services are required for meaningful results.** Most tests depend on PostgreSQL,
MinIO, and Redis. Always run `./run_pytest.sh` (which starts services automatically).
Never use `--no-services` unless you are certain the test has no service fixtures.

### Step 1: Reproduce locally

Always start by running the failing test locally with full services:

```bash
# Run all tests with services (default)
./run_pytest.sh

# Run a specific test file
./run_pytest.sh test/test_<name>.py

# Run with visible browser (Playwright debugging)
./run_pytest.sh --headed test/test_<name>.py

# Use local soil-moisture-prediction repo (sibling directory)
./run_pytest.sh --local-smp test/test_<name>.py
```

**Important:** Always use `./run_pytest.sh` (without `--no-services`) for
verification. See [Testing conventions](../conventions/testing.md).

**Outcome:**

- Passes locally → skip to **Step 5** (CI-specific issues)
- Fails locally → **examine artifacts first** (see below), then continue to **Step 2**

**Examine artifacts immediately after failure:**

Artifacts are captured automatically in `test/artifacts/` on every Playwright test
failure. Before diving into code, check them:

```bash
# View screenshot — is the page in the expected state?
open test/artifacts/<test-dir>/test-failed-1.png

# Step through the trace — DOM, network, action timeline
npx playwright show-trace test/artifacts/<test-dir>/trace.zip

# Check browser console for JS errors
cat test/artifacts/<test-dir>/console.log

# Check server logs for callback errors/exceptions
cat test/artifacts/<test-dir>/server.log

# Inspect the DOM at the moment of failure
open test/artifacts/<test-dir>/page.html
```

| Artifact | What it tells you |
|----------|-------------------|
| `test-failed-1.png` | Visual state — is the element on screen? Is an overlay blocking? |
| `trace.zip` | Full action replay — step through clicks, network requests, DOM changes |
| `console.log` | Browser-side errors — failed resource loads, JS exceptions |
| `server.log` | Dash callback logs — exceptions, callback ordering, timing |
| `page.html` | DOM structure — missing elements, wrong IDs, hidden components |

**Common startup failures:**

| Error | Cause | Fix |
|-------|-------|-----|
| `PostgreSQL not available` | DB container failed health check | `docker logs postgres_cosmopolitan` |
| `MinIO not available` | Object storage failed health check | `docker logs minio_cosmopolitan` |
| `Redis not available` | Redis failed health check | `docker logs redis_cosmopolitan` |
| Port already in use | Leftover Docker containers or another process | 1. `docker compose down` in the current project first. 2. If persists, tell the user which port is blocked — a sibling project (cosmonaut, etc.) may be running in parallel and only the user knows which is safe to stop. |
| Docker not running | Docker daemon not started | `sudo systemctl start docker` |

---

### Step 2: Does the test need services?

Check the test function signature for fixture dependencies:

- Has `dash_app` or `celery_worker` parameter → **requires services**
- No service fixtures → can run with `--no-services`

| Requires services | No services needed |
|---|---|
| `test_e2e.py` | `test_env.py` |
| `test_postgres_manager.py` | `test_smp_assumptions.py` |
| `test_update_measurements.py` | `test_documentation.py` |
| `test_background_job_manager.py` | |

Running a service-dependent test with `--no-services` produces connection
failures, not meaningful results. If unsure, run with services.

---

### Step 3: Check if test is flaky

**Symptoms:**

- Test passes sometimes, fails other times
- Timeout errors on `expect().to_be_visible()`
- Different behavior with `--headed` vs headless

**Diagnostic — run 3-5 times:**

```bash
for i in {1..5}; do
    echo "--- Run $i ---"
    ./run_pytest.sh test/test_<name>.py || break
done
```

**Run with visible browser to observe timing:**

```bash
./run_pytest.sh --headed test/test_<name>.py
```

**Common timing fixes:**

| Issue | Fix |
|-------|-----|
| Element not rendered yet | Add `expect(page.locator(f"#{ID}")).to_be_visible()` before interaction |
| Background job not complete | Increase timeout: `expect(...).to_be_enabled(timeout=120000)` |
| Callback race condition | Add `check_all_errors(page)` after navigation |
| Upload not processed | Wait for upload confirmation before next action |

---

### Step 4: Check service health

If tests require services and startup errors occur, verify each service manually.

**PostgreSQL:**

```bash
docker ps | grep postgres_cosmopolitan
docker logs postgres_cosmopolitan
docker exec postgres_cosmopolitan pg_isready -U cosmopolitan
```

**MinIO:**

```bash
docker ps | grep minio_cosmopolitan
docker logs minio_cosmopolitan
curl -sf http://localhost:9010/minio/health/ready
```

**Redis:**

```bash
docker ps | grep redis_cosmopolitan
docker logs redis_cosmopolitan
docker exec redis_cosmopolitan redis-cli ping
```

**Clean up and restart:**

When `run_pytest.sh` fails with `PostgreSQL not available` despite the health check
passing, the containers are likely in a stale state from a previous run. **Always
`docker compose down` before retrying** — `run_pytest.sh` only starts containers, it
does not restart them:

```bash
docker compose down
./run_pytest.sh
```

If lingering containers cause port conflicts:

```bash
docker ps -a | grep cosmopolitan
docker compose down --remove-orphans
```

---

### Step 5: CI pipeline issues (passes locally, fails in CI)

**Environment differences:**

| Aspect | Local (`env_test_local`) | CI (`env_test`) |
|--------|--------------------------|------------------|
| PostgreSQL | `localhost:5433` | `postgres:5432` |
| MinIO | `localhost:9010` | `minio:9000` |
| Redis | `localhost:6380` | `redis:6379` |
| Browser | `--headed` option available | headless only |
| Services | Docker Compose containers | GitLab service containers |

**CI artifacts:** On failure, GitLab archives `test/artifacts/` (7-day retention).
Download from the pipeline job page → "Job artifacts". Contains the same screenshots,
traces, HTML snapshots, console logs, and server logs as local runs.

**Common CI-specific failures:**

1. **Hardcoded hostnames or ports** — use config vars from `cosmopolitan_app/config.py`, never literals
2. **Hardcoded absolute file paths** — use paths relative to project root
3. **Test assumes visible browser** — remove any `headless=False`; use fixtures, not manual browser setup
4. **Missing test files** — check that files are committed and not in `.gitignore`

**Compare environment files:**

```bash
diff env_test env_test_local
```

**Check CI pipeline configuration:** `.gitlab-ci.yml`

### Step 6: Common failure patterns

| Symptom | Likely Cause | Artifact to check | Fix |
|---------|--------------|-------------------|-----|
| `locator.click: Timeout 30000ms exceeded` | Element not visible or overlay blocking | Screenshot, trace | Add `expect().to_be_visible()` before interaction; wait for overlay to close |
| `PostgreSQL not available` | DB container not healthy | — | Check Docker logs, verify ports in `env_test_local` |
| `ModuleNotFoundError` | Missing dependency or inline import | — | Run `uv sync`; move import to top level |
| `AssertionError` | Test expectation does not match behavior | Screenshot, server.log | Verify whether test or code is wrong |
| `Celery worker failed to start` | Redis broker issue or import error | — | Check Redis is running; check worker imports |
| Passes locally, fails CI | Environment differences | CI artifacts | Check config vars vs hardcoded values; compare `env_test` and `env_test_local` |
| Random pass/fail (flaky) | Race condition, insufficient waits | Trace | Add explicit waits with appropriate timeouts |

---

### Step 7: Fix and verify

1. **Make the fix**
2. **Run the specific failing test:**
   ```bash
   ./run_pytest.sh test/test_<name>.py
   ```
3. **Run the full test suite:**
   ```bash
   ./run_pytest.sh
   ```
4. **If timing-related, check for flakiness** (run 3-5 times)
5. **Push and verify CI pipeline passes**
