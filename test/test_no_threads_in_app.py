"""app.py must not start a thread, nor Celery Beat.

Gunicorn with --preload imports app.py once and forks its workers from that
process. A thread running at that moment can hold one of Celery's internal locks,
and the forked worker then blocks forever on its first task submission — no error,
no log line, just a request that never returns. Without --preload every worker
imports app.py, and a Beat started there runs once per worker. Beat belongs in the
Celery worker (``--beat``); see docs/conventions/celery_beat.md in cosmo-suite.

Read from the source: importing app.py would boot the whole app.
